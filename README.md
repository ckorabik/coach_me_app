For runners

## Project Structure
Ultimately we'd like to have:
- A Python project
  - Reads data from Garmin, Strava, & Apple
  - Creates models that take run/HR data and can predict estimated fitness metrics
  - API to interface with Web UI to provide insights
- Web interface
  - High level education on different running "zones"
    - More in depth explanations on what each zone is used for
      - Links to research, other websites, info on books for anyone really looking to dig into it
  - Dashboard with metrics for the week
  - Cool graphs :)
- iPhone/Android apps
  - We can worry about this once we have something that works
